# week 1: variable and data type

- System is a class that is why it start with capital letter.
    - example System.out.print()

- all java variable must have unique name and begin with letter
- case sensitive

- final variable can not be changed and read-only;
- example, final int NUM = 10;

- String firstname = "John";

- use var keyword to declare a variable that you dont know what type
- example, var name = "John";

- primitive: specifies the size and type of variable value and it has no additional methods, they are predefined in java
    - example, boolean, char, number

- reference: they refer to objects and they all have the same methods and properties
    - example, String, ArrayList, class interface

    - .trim()
    - .replace()
    - .split()
    - .contains()
